# A/B testing for a dating app
This is a project on A/B testing a feature for a dating app. I analyse users' match rates and match attempts to figure out if the new matching algorithm is worth pursuing and help people find their true love
According to my findings, the test group showed statistically significant improvement regarding the key and proxy metrics, so there is reason to implement the new feature. 

### Tools and libraries used:
- Python,
- Pandas,
